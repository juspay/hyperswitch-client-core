# Active Context: Hyperswitch Client Core

## Current Work Focus

### Memory Bank Initialization - JUST COMPLETED
- **Status**: Memory bank successfully initialized with all core files
- **Action**: Created foundational documentation structure for the project
- **Files Created**:
  - `projectbrief.md`: Core project overview and requirements
  - `productContext.md`: Business context and user experience goals
  - `systemPatterns.md`: Architecture patterns and technical decisions
  - `techContext.md`: Technology stack and development setup
  - `activeContext.md`: Current document tracking active work
  - `progress.md`: Next file to be created

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Complete memory bank initialization by creating `progress.md`
2. Validate memory bank structure and content
3. Ready for future development work

## Recent Changes
- **2025-01-07**: Initial memory bank creation
  - Analyzed project structure and key files (README.md, package.json)
  - Examined source code organization and architecture
  - Created comprehensive documentation covering all core aspects
  - Established baseline for future memory bank updates

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Project Understanding
- **Core Technology**: ReScript-based functional programming approach
- **Platform Strategy**: Cross-platform SDK with shared JavaScript core
- **Architecture**: Git submodule structure for platform-specific implementations
- **Target Platforms**: Web, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter

### Documentation Strategy
- **Memory Bank Structure**: Following hierarchical file organization
- **Content Depth**: Comprehensive coverage of technical and business context
- **Future Updates**: Ready for incremental updates as work progresses
- **Integration**: Aligns with existing .clinerules for memory management

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **ReScript First**: Primary development language for type safety
- **Functional Approach**: Immutable data and pure functions preferred
- **Component Structure**: Clear separation of concerns with modular design
- **Cross-Platform**: Shared core logic with platform-specific adapters

### Development Workflow
- **Quality First**: Strong emphasis on linting, formatting, and testing
- **Automation**: Extensive use of automated tools for builds and releases
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all major components
- **Security**: PCI compliance and secure payment processing requirements

### Technical Preferences
- **Type Safety**: ReScript provides compile-time guarantees
- **Performance**: Mobile-first optimization with bundle size considerations
- **Testing**: Multi-level testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e)
- **Monitoring**: Production monitoring with Sentry and custom logging

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Key Discoveries
1. **Sophisticated Architecture**: Well-designed cross-platform architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. **Mature Tooling**: Comprehensive build and development infrastructure
3. **Security Focus**: Strong emphasis on payment security and compliance
4. **Multi-Platform Complexity**: Significant coordination required across platform implementations

### Technical Insights
- **ReScript Benefits**: Type safety and functional programming provide robust foundation
- **Submodule Strategy**: Git submodules enable platform-specific development while sharing core logic
- **Bundle Management**: Platform-specific bundling strategies optimize for each target environment
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing setup with platform-specific tools

### Development Considerations
- **Environment Setup**: Complex multi-platform development environment requirements
- **Dependency Management**: Multiple package managers and platform-specific dependencies
- **Build Process**: Sophisticated build pipeline with platform-specific outputs
- **Release Coordination**: Coordinated releases across multiple platforms and repositories

## Context for Future Sessions

### Project State
- **Memory Bank**: Fully initialized and ready for incremental updates
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive baseline established
- **Understanding**: Deep understanding of project architecture and goals
- **Next Steps**: Ready for specific development tasks or feature work

### Key Reference Points
- **Main README**: Comprehensive setup and development instructions
- **Package.json**: Current dependencies and available scripts
- **Source Structure**: Well-organized ReScript/JavaScript codebase
- **Platform Directories**: iOS and Android submodules for native implementations

### Areas for Future Exploration
